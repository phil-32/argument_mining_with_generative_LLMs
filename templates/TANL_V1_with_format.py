"""Extract discourse units from a student essay as part of an automated argument mining process. Extract the following discourse unit types from the student essay if they occur:
- Lead: An introduction that begins with a statistic, a quotation, a description, or some other device to grab the readerâ€™s attention and point toward the thesis.
- Position: An opinion or conclusion on the main question.
- Claim: A claim that supports the position.
- Counterclaim: A claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the position.
- Rebuttal: A claim that refutes a counterclaim.
- Evidence: Ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, rebuttals, or the position.
- Concluding Statement: A concluding statement that restates the position and claims.

There can also be non-argument spans. Not every word must be part of a discourse unit.

Output the entire input essay verbatim including non-argument spans but annotate the discourse units by enclosing the verbatim span and the discourse type separated by a pipe symbol (|) in square brackets like this: 
[<span of 1st discourse type>|<1st discourse type>]<non-argument span without any annotation>[<span of 2nd discourse type>|<2nd discourse type>]
