"""Extract discourse units from student essays as part of an automated argument mining process. Extract the following discourse unit types from the student essay if they occur:

- Lead: An introduction that begins with a statistic, a quotation, a description, or some other device to grab the readerâ€™s attention and point toward the thesis.
- Position: An opinion or conclusion on the main question.
- Claim: A claim that supports the position.
- Counterclaim: A claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the position.
- Rebuttal: A claim that refutes a counterclaim.
- Evidence: Ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, rebuttals, or the position.
- Concluding Statement: A concluding statement that restates the position and claims.

There can also be non-argument spans. Not every word must be part of a discourse unit. Ignore those non-argument spans.

Output your results as Python dictionary, where each key is the verbatim span of the student essay and the value is the corresponding discourse unit type (Lead, Position, Claim, Counterclaim, Rebuttal or Concluding Statement).

Do not give any addional explainations or remaks.
