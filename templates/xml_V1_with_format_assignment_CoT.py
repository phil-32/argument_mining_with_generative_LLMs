The assignment of the given essay is to express one’s opinion about using cell phones while driving. The assignment does not contain any information about a source text, which means that it is likely an independent task and the evidence and claims are produced by the author. The first part of the essay "Should drivers be able to use their phones while driving? GPS, Instagram, Facebook" is repeating the assignment and is supposed to introduce the topic to the reader. Hence, its discourse type is Lead. By saying "distractions shouldn't be allowed while operating a 2 ton vehicle capable of killing someone and yourself within seconds" the author expresses his position towards the topic of the essay, which he backs up with the evidence "With a split second decision you could be dead or responsible for a death for a text message or a video or post something that would've been there later on.". In the next paragraph the author starts with the claim "Did you know texting and driving is one of the leading causes of vehicle deaths.", which support his adverse position towards using cell phones while driving. Until the end of the paragraph the author expresses his ideas that further support his claim and position by giving examples of possible consequences: "With just a slight 2 second check of a message can cause you to be in prisoned for vehicular homicide causing you not to be able to text, talk, and touch to that person as much as you want. You could your freedom behind it. Your Family could lose they child, cousin, sister, brother, niece or nephew behind a simple "ok". You could be preparing your family for a funeral or a court date. A casket or a cell. A T shirt or a Suit. Worse than that you could possible deal with the conscious of killing someone. 3,287 deaths because of distracted driving in 2018." In the following "What apps are included in these "distractions"? Should GPS count? GPS should count for 2 reason. While GPS has been very beneficial in the 20 century" the author gives possible reasons for using a cell phone, which opposes his original position and hence is a counterclaim. By saying "however in GPS requires attention of the driver" he quickly refutes the counterclaim, which makes this a rebuttal. This rebuttal is followed by further evidence which supports the rebuttal by saying: "For instance the driver the driver missed what the GPS says and pick up the phone to check to see where to turn now while a minority of drivers have a type of device to hold their phone up near the face to be able to see without looking down but a majority of driver use there cup holder and with that they have to bring they attention off the road for a certain amount of time. Although that's that one driver issue it only takes one domino to knock the whole thing down meaning It can cause the whole street to be endangered. Also with GPS drivers tend to pull risky and immature decision to make a correction after missing a turn cause the proper procedures to not be follow and having other drivers confused which can cause a crash and more." The next paragraph is introduced by another claim "While driving do you ever think you're responsible for the whole car? The operator of the vehicle is responsible for everybody inside the vehicle.", giving another reason for the position of the author. This is backed by further evidence: "For instance god forbid (2x knocks on wood) say your operating a vehicle a with a family member you care for inside and you went to check a message for 0.9 second within that time you are partially over the on the express way you are struck by a tractor trailer on the right side cause your car to roll multiple times. Your roof in pounded inside and your family member is hurt traumatically. Now you're put in a situation you can't control because you made a decision you could've controlled. Would you be ok with being the murder of a loved one?". More examples that support the position of the author are given in the next paragraph: "What about in case of an emergency? In case of an emergency you should have your destination set before driving and If not you should pull up to see how you should address the situation and in case you need to make a phone you should have a passenger assist", which ends with a claim "if there isn't one then pull along the shoulder and call who is needed while operating the car speaker could be an important sources or reliable resource". The last paragraph contains the concluding statement restating the author's position: "In conclusion, use technology while driving isn't safe. I don't think it should be a thing. With the new technology in the 20century it will be possible to make calls text people back without even touching your phone just based off the development of technology" The last part "When you drive , drive safe for your family and for all that care about you and for safety of the other drivers." is not part of any discourse unit. It is just a kind of farewell and thus a non argument span.
